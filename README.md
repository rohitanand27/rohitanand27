💡 About Me
I'm a passionate and curious software developer focused on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I enjoy building intelligent systems and real-world applications that solve problems and provide insights from data.

During my internship at Deepcept AI, I gained practical experience in:

Developing and deploying ML models using Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn

Creating interactive AI apps with Gradio and Streamlit

Working with SQL, GCP, and Docker for scalable solutions

I love exploring new tools and contributing to open-source projects when I can. Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to work on impactful AI/ML projects and collaborate with like-minded developers.
